README for 'acct' component - Account-level resources

This component is intended to be run to set up things (such as a DNS subdomain) at the account level, and this should be run for each account belonging to the Notify Domain - i.e. there should be a nonprod and prod environment .tfvars

Copy the `env_eu-west-2_example.tfvars` file in the `etc` directory and adjust as needed for nonprod and prod for your NHS Notify Domain.
